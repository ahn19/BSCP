### Shape recognition based on the combination of contour information and skeleton information.

Codes for our **PRL2016** paper: **"Shape Recognition by Bag of Skeleton-associated Contour Parts"**. [[arxiv]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1605.06417)

### Requirements:

1. Dataset: we use **Animal Dataset** [[paper]](http://mc.eistar.net/UpLoadFiles/Papers/%5b11%5d%202009%20ICCV%20Workshop%20Baixiang.pdf) for training and testing. The dataset contains 2000 images, which are divided into 20 classes. We extend the dataset by adding the corresponding skeleton-associated contour maps and the extended dataset will be uploaded in a few days.

2. Tools: you might download the **pdollar's toolbox** [[github]](https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox) and the **liblinear** [[download]](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/liblinear/), and put them into the "include" directory.

3. Inference: please see exp_animal.m

More technical details details please refer to our paper.

If you find bugs or have questions, please contact me. Glad to hear from you.
